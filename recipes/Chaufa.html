            <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 lb (450 g) diced chicken breast (or pork/shrimp/tofu)

            </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 scallions, sliced (whites and greens separated)

            </li>
            <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp oyster sauce (optional, for depth)

            </li>
            <li>1 tsp sesame oil

            </li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste

            </li>
            <li>1 tsp grated fresh ginger (optional)</li>
            <li>1 small red bell pepper, diced (optional)

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
             <li>Scramble eggs: Heat a splash of oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat, pour in beaten eggs, scramble quickly, then transfer to a plate.

             </li>
             <li>Cook protein: In the same pan, add oil and sauté diced chicken (or your choice) with a pinch of salt and pepper until cooked through; push to the side.

             </li>
             <li>Aromatics: Add garlic (and ginger if using) to the pan, stir 10 s, then toss in the white parts of the scallions and bell pepper—cook until just softened.

             </li> 
             <li>Rice & sauces: Crumble in chilled rice, drizzle soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil over top, then stir-fry until everything’s evenly coated and hot.

             </li>
             <li>Finish & serve: Return the scrambled eggs, add the green scallion tops, toss once more, taste-adjust with salt/pepper, then plate and enjoy!

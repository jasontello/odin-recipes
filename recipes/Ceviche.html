        <h2>Description</h2>
        <P>Peruvian ceviche, cebiche, sebiche, or seviche is a traditional dish widely eaten in Peru especially in the coastal region of the country. Ceviche is made and eaten throughout the whole year, but mostly served in the summer due to its refreshing and cold taste. It is also consumed for celebrations such as Fiestas Patrias. The national plate can be considered different from other countries due to its distinct and unique preparation that contains lime juice, fish, sweet potatoes and other foods.
